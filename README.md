Welcome to the Blessed-IFAL-WebDev repository! ðŸš€

## Introduction

Blessed-IFAL-WebDev is a collaborative project initiated by a group of passionate students from Instituto Federal de Alagoas (IFAL). Our mission is to empower incoming freshmen with introductory web development classes, equipping them with essential digital skills to succeed in today's technology-driven world.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

This project is built using the following technologies:

- React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We chose React.js for its simplicity, component-based architecture, and reusability, providing an optimal learning experience for our students.

- Bootstrap: A powerful front-end framework that offers a collection of pre-built components and styles. Bootstrap enables us to create responsive, visually appealing, and user-friendly interfaces with ease.
